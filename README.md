# BashScript
This script will help organize disk usage, free memory. free disk space, and open files. Its nothing much but would be useful
Command should be run with sudo

Before running this script make sure the directory ~/backups is made along with ~/backups/{diskuse,freemem,freedisk,openlist}

mkdir ~/backups
mkdir ~/backups/{diskuse,freemem,freedisk,openlist}

use chmod +x system.sh (to make file executable)

Linux users, this should work fine. Mac users "free" will not work but the rest of the script will. Windows please use GitBash
